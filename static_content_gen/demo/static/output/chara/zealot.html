	<p><img width="50%" src="../image/zealot.jpg">Zealots are lower-ranked Templar who have yet to reach the upper levels of the Khala.[1] They form the backbone of the protoss military,[2] and have been utilized since before the Discord.[3] At least some, if not all Khalai zealots are members of the Zealot Order. Zealots honor the moon Saalok as their order's symbol, which they call the Zealous Round.[4] Zealots can operate in platoons[5] and legions.[6] The Tal'darim also employ zealots.[7][8] As the lowest ranking links in the Chain of Ascension, they are the ones most eager to prove themselves.</p>
